===========

Simulator for the PaderKicker project group.

PaderKicker project is a student project aiming at programming 
the Bebots to be able to play the game of CTF (Catch The Flag).

This simulator is intended for creating a virtual environment
and virtual robots simulating the real world and real Bebots,
so that the code for driving the real Bebots can be first tested
under this simulator.

This repo is only for backing-up the code, it will receive no updates.
